# Ender3ProMarlin1.1.9Firmware
Custom Marlin 1.1.9 firmware utilizing a BLTOUCH and a (highly recommended) silent 1.1.5 motherboard upgrade

I did not install via the hex but rather uploaded to my printer via the arduino IDE.

I removed several features so the program would fit on the board, such as some LCD menus and the speaker.

This worked for me but use at your own risk.
